## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue

This project is the second iteration of this app. First iteration was written with React. This app uses Vue for the UI. It dives deep into Vue components, props, and working with a json-server (fake REST api) to store and manipulate task data.

## Optimizations

For future iterations of this project, I would love to add specific time inputs and have a more deatiled form for each task. I'd like the Task component to be more detailed and add features like highlighting the specific tasks that are overdue.

## Lessons Learned:

I loved using json-server. It allows us to create a mock REST API with our own data. We can create a db.json file with some data where we can make POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE requests and saves changes to the db.json. It even creates unique IDs like a real backend database would.
